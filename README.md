# miniPiTFT Interface for PADD for Pi-Hole
#
# If you have any display bigger than a mini PiTFT, this will probably not work for you. This is only intended for people with the miniPiTFT screen, which with stock code, is massively underutilized.
#
# 
# Use file PADDD.sh (one extra 'D') to test the changes i've made. Make sure to back up your original file, or have the original on hand.
# View the original project and unfucked code here: https://github.com/jpmck/PADD
