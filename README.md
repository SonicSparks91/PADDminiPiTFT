# miniPiTFT Interface for PADD for Pi-Hole
#
# Welcome! Don't expect much from this, I've fucked up alot of the code, so If you have any display bigger than a mini PiTFT, this will probably not work for you.
# 
# Use file PADDD.sh to test the changes i've made. A miniPiTFT is consitered a "Pico" display, most of my changes are made there.
